# 💫 About Me:
Hi there!<br><br>I'm Mehdi, a 23-year-old French student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the **University of Montpellier**, but most importantly, I'm a code enthusiast!<br><br>I've been coding since I was 14, starting with Python. After high school, I initially majored in mathematics and had a moderate interest in programming. However, I soon decided to switch fields to dive into the world of computers, coding, and data where there's heaps of interesting things to learn about from low-level to high-level.<br>I am very happy with my decision, even if it can be challenging at times. Those few nights spent like a zombie in front of my laptop can be tough, but it is what it is.<br>I aspire to become a software developer/programmer, and for that practice is key.<br>Here, you can follow my coding journey by checking out my repositories!<br><br>---<br><br>### Note on my repositories<br><br>* For now, most of my repositories are projects from my university assignments (starting from the time I was still a mathematics major student up to my current studies) that I wanted to share.<br>* I haven't pushed all my projects in chronological order. If you see a recent repository with code that seems more beginner-level than an older one, this is probably why. I'll try to update the individual READMEs to specify when each project was actually coded.<br>* I used to code primarily in French (comments, variable names, function names, file names). I've recently switched to coding exclusively in English. I find it's often more concise, clear, and many computer science terms don't translate well from English to French so I figured it's best that way (but if needed I am not opposed to code again in French).
